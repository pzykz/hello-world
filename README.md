Hi, my name is Nik.
Although i am new to coding, business informatics and related topics i have always loved working on and with PC's since i was a kid. When i received my first Pentium II with 233 MHz and 1.4GB of storage my addiction to computer and videogames started. So now, that i am fulltime on this topic, i cannot await what the future holds for me.
